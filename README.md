=========

Lootify turns your items into one-time lootable inventories with preset or random items.

* Make ***flexible*** lootboxes for several purposes, like events, minigames or vote rewards
* Don't bother with a complex command syntax. Creating items is as easy as `/lootify create item MyItem`
* Or use it to save your custom items. Re-create them with `/lootify get item MyItem`
* Organize your items with pools by grouping them like Group.MyItem
